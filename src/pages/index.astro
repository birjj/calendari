  <PageHeader>Welcome to <emph>Calendari</emph></PageHeader>
  <p>
    <emph>Calendari</emph> is an API for synchronizing calendars from various sources
    that don't provide a calendar interface of their own.
  </p>
  <p>
    It works by allowing you to send simple HTTP requests to add, modify and
    delete events to calendars. These calendars can then be exported to all
    commonly available calendar providers.
  </p>
  <CalendariGraph />
  <p>
    It is assumed that you have some programmatic experience, as you will need
    to send the events yourself using our HTTP API.
  </p>
  <p>
    To get started, log in using one of the below providers.<br />
    {
      import.meta.env["CALENDARI_AUTH_WHITELIST"]
        ? "If you've been whitelisted, an account will be automatically generated for you."
        : "If you don't already have an account, one will be automatically generated for you."
    }
  </p>
